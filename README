First, the original data were in hg18/GCRh36, and marker info needs to be updated
and re-aligned.

These are the keep steps:
	1. The original data were at /home/pkchen/autism/data_afterQC
	2. The plink data were then copied to the folder: step0-rename
		nothing has changed in this folder except the names
	3. we used liftOver to provide new chromomal positions fpr hg19/GRCh17.
		In all, 102 markers cannot be mapped. They stored at: miss-liftover-failed102-with-rs.txt
